# AI-powered-Speech-transcription-and-Language-translation
This repo contains a class for transcribing audio conversations (either Live or recorded) and for translating spoken words between languages - currently supports 44 languages.

This is just a fun project for use in a customer call center where staffers do not need to manually transcribe the relevant points of their conversations with clients as this allows for audio transcription and summarization, using a number of packages.

Also, it can serve as an intermediary for bi-lateral communication between two speakers on a phone call who happen to speak different languages. The AI systems comes in between both callers and translates spoken words in one language to the other and vice versa.
